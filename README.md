## What is a Web Browser ?
A web browser (also referred to as an Internet browser or simply a browser) is application software for accessing the World Wide Web or a local website. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves its files from a web server and then graphically renders the page on the user's screen.

A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[1][2] A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.[3]
